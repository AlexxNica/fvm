        With Filecoin and IPFS, content-addressed data may be stored anywhere in
        the globe. Furthermore, the structure of datasets varies dramatically.
        Data can be coarse or fine-grained, and its individual units can be
        hash-linked with [IPLD](https://ipld.io/). Data can be highly capillarized
        and disseminated throughout the network. As a result, segments of
        a given dataset may be stored far away from one another.
        <br />
        <br />
        Frequently, users want to execute data pipelines to validate, transform,
        aggregate, normalize, and generally process datasets to extract insights,
        construct models, and derive new value. Regrouping highly distributed data
        into a central location to perform compute on it is expensive, underperformant,
        and undesirable. Therefore, pushing compute to the edges and creating systems
        to coordinate decentralized computation pipelines is a must.
        <br />
        <br />
        FVM actors can help to broker computational resources, incentivize execution,
        distribute workloads, and prove the validity of the result in order to claim
        rewards.

    topic: "Perpetual Storage",
    description: (
      <React.Fragment>
        Many common-good datasets rely on stewarding organizations to ensure
        their preservation and continued revision (e.g. a government,
        corporation, or non-profit). Frequently, the responsibility lies on
        a single organization. If that organization goes away or changes
        motivation, the common-good data could be lost forever, resulting in a
        loss for society.
        <br />
        <br />
        With smart contracts, the responsibility of ensuring valuable data is
        kept alive can be shared collectively, and its continuation and renewal
        can guaranteed by permissionless code running autonomously on-chain -
        with no risk of modification or alteration of the underlying datasets.
        Funding mechanisms can be coupled with [DataDAOs](/datadaos) and
        [Staking Protocols](/staking-protocols) to enable pay-once-store-forever
        mechanics.

        Example use cases: Crime statistics, inflation metrics, election
        results.

    topic: "Insurance Protocols",
    description: (
      <React.Fragment>
        When offering storage services to the network, storage providers are
        required to put a large amount of collateral. Insurance protocols allow
        storage providers can better select risk to align with their desired
        profile by offering fees to investors. Investors (or DAOs) can receive a
        revenue stream by purchasing said risk in exchange for recurring fees.
      </React.Fragment>
    ),

  {
    topic: "Storage Derivatives",
    description: (
      <React.Fragment>
        The dynamic nature of decentralized storage costs cause planning
        challenges for both producers and consumers. Data producers will need to
        store data in the future for a predefined period of time and will want
        to budget in costs now (e.g. a bank who knows they will need to store 1
        TB of 2021 transaction data from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022).
        Storage providers will want to know how much to spend on hardware based
        on their predicted earnings. Providing a way to smooth predictability
        about future costs and returns will bring stability to this market and
        reduce risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        By enabling users to “pre-buy” a chunk of storage space at a specific
        price today, a data producer will be able to predict their costs over a
        given period of time. By enabling a storage producer to bid on
        delivering a block of storage in the future, they will be able to
        purchase hardware and be more secure that they are margin positive.

    topic: "Staking Protocols",
    description: (
      <React.Fragment>
        Staking Protocols can substantially improve the capital efficiency in
        the Filecoin economy - matching yield-seeking token holders and
        liquidity-seeking storage providers. With staking protocols, token
        holders can trustlessly pool their assets and set rules and terms by
        which storage providers (of any size) can permissionlessly access that
        liquidity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Staking protocols can use on-chain metrics (e.g. longevity of an
        address, history of slashing) to better assess risk while also allowing
        storage providers of all sizes to access capital.{" "}

        DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are member-owned

          computation fabrics, and incentive-aligned Content Delivery Networks),
          to cross-chain interoperability bridges (e.g. connecting Filecoin with Ethereum,
          Solana, NEAR, and more, in a trustless manner), to data-oriented Decentralized
          Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).
